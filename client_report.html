    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use?</strong> I used the site plan to choose content that clearly explained the purpose of the site and supported the theme. I selected images that matched the topic and helped the pages feel complete and consistent with the wireframe.</p>
    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Any issues?</strong> I communicated by sharing the site plan, links, and feedback as pages were published. Communication was mostly smooth, and when issues came up, they were usually related to waiting for files to be pushed before work could continue.</p>
    <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations?</strong> Yes. The homepage was published correctly and updated with CSS styling to match the site plan and wireframe.</p>
    <p><strong>What will you do differently next time?</strong> Next time I would set clearer deadlines and check-in times, and I would confirm file structure (CSS file name, image folder, link paths) earlier so fewer small issues slow down progress.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you manage your team and communicate tasks?</strong> I shared the repository, provided the expected page assignments, and made sure junior developers knew to use the same stylesheet and pull changes before editing.</p>
    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client? Any issues?</strong> I sent the published site link, asked for feedback after updates, and confirmed when changes were live. Communication was clear and there were no major issues.</p>
    <p><strong>How did you publish the site and share it?</strong> I published using GitHub Pages and verified the live URL after pushing updates. I shared the link with the client and my junior developers so everyone could review the current version.</p>
    <p><strong>How was your experience managing the site with GitHub?</strong> It was a good learning experience. Pulling before editing and pushing updates helped avoid overwriting each other’s work, and GitHub Pages made it easy to verify changes.</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p><strong>How did you communicate with your team leads? Any issues?</strong> I confirmed my page assignments early and provided updates when my pages were completed. The main issue I ran into was being blocked when a lead developer had not yet pushed the required HTML/CSS structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Did you know what was expected for each site?</strong> Yes. Each team had a site plan and homepage structure to follow, which made expectations clear.</p>
    <p><strong>Were you able to contribute?</strong> Yes. I completed and styled my assigned pages for one team and communicated completion to the lead developer.</p>
    <p><strong>Any GitHub issues?</strong> The biggest challenge was making sure I pulled the latest changes before editing to avoid conflicts. Once I followed that habit, it went smoothly.</p>

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <p><strong>Most challenging part:</strong> The most challenging part was coordinating timing and making sure everyone had pushed the files needed before the next person could work. I overcame it by communicating clearly and checking the repo often.</p>
    <p><strong>What did you enjoy most?</strong> I enjoyed seeing the site go from a plan to a real published project, and I liked learning how teamwork changes how you code and organize files.</p>
    <p><strong>What would you do differently?</strong> I would create a shared checklist at the start and confirm consistent naming (CSS files, folders, and links) so the team stays aligned.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you feel more confident now?</strong> Yes. This project made me more confident working with GitHub, communicating tasks, and contributing to a team project with real workflow steps like pull, commit, push, and publish.</p>
