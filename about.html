      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello! My name is Benjamin Smith, and I am currently a student in WDD 130.
        I’m learning the fundamentals of web development including HTML, CSS,
        layout design, and how to build simple websites. I enjoy the creative
        process of turning ideas into real webpages that people can interact with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of class I enjoy playing basketball and tennis, diving into new books,
        and spending time with my friends. These activities help me stay balanced,
        active, and inspired in different parts of my life. Whether I'm on the court,
        reading something new, or just hanging around, I'm always looking for ways to
        grow, learn, and enjoy myself in day-to-day life.

      <h3>Goals for This Class</h3>

      <p>
        By the end of WDD 130, I want to feel confident creating multi-page websites,
        designing clean page layouts, and understanding how to write organized HTML
        and CSS code. This portal page is my first major step toward building a real web
        portfolio.
